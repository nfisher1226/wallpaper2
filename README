Lightweight graphical wallpaper setter for Linux using gtkdialog for the
gui. Wallpaper2 is a scratch rewrite of the old wallpaper setter written
for Grafpup and Puppy linux. It has been designed to handle multiple
backends for background setting and preview generation and to behave in
general more like a compiled program than a shell script.

The current backends for preview generation are:
netpbm
imagemagick

The current backends for backdrop setting are:
ROX-Filer
feh

The current status of the project is just a gui mockup that cannot yet
actually set your wallpaper. This will however be changing in the very
near future.
