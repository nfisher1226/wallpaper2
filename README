Lightweight graphical wallpaper setter for Linux using gtkdialog for the
gui. Gwp is a scratch rewrite of the old wallpaper setter written
for Grafpup and Puppy linux. It has been designed to handle multiple
backends for background setting and preview generation and to behave in
general more like a compiled program than a shell script.

The current backends for backdrop setting are:
ROX-Filer
feh
esetroot
imlibsetroot
